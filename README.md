# Sales-Insights-Analysis-by-Power-BI-MYSQL
Excited to share my recent project where I conducted insightful data analysis on Swiggy's operational metrics using MySQL. Leveraging SQL queries, I delved into Swiggy's database to uncover valuable insights. This project not only honed my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of the food delivery industry.
